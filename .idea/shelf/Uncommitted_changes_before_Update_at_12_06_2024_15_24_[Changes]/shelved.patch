After two other successful EP projects, he recorded his first album in 2020 entitled <a href = ./Trinity.html> \"Trinity\".</a>\r\n                He created a whole new universe to tell his story. Mixing digital and real worlds, he created a piece of art that had never been done before in French rap. The story tells us about a love story between him and a software that plays the role of a woman.\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                One year later, he came back with a short film to announce his second album <a href = ./Anderson.html> “L’histoire étrange de Monsieur Anderson”.</a> Again, the album isn’t only a series of singles but really a story about the artist himself. This time Mr Anderson represents an alter ego of laylow and teaches us about how laylow feels.\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                This success was affirmed by the two sold-out Accor Hotel Arena in which he performed in 2022. He really stands as one of the main figures of French rap and especially as a precursor of a new type of art mixing music and 7th Art…\r\n                    <video id=\"video_concert\" onclick=\"muteVideo()\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loop autoplay muted>\r\n                        <source src=\"../video/laylow_concert.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\n                        Your browser does not support the video tag.\r\n                    </video>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <footer>\r\n            <p><a href=\"About.html\">About</a></p>\r\n            <br>\r\n            <p>© Copyright - All right reserved</p>\r\n            <p>Marley Menard - Eugénie Titouche</p>\r\n        </footer>\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>\r\n
